ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently self-studying machine learning through a paper by Mehta et al. entitled [A high-bias, low-variance introduction to Machine Learning for physicists](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08823).

ðŸš€ Also picking up Java through University of Helsinki's MOOC and Coursera's Algorithms, Parts [I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) and [II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2).
